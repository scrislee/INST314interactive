Description: From Adam Gilbert, agmath: This package deploys interactive 
    tutorials for a first course in applied statistics. It follows the 
    OpenIntro Statistics textbook and includes several resources adapted from 
    that project.  This is a version tailored to INST314.  So all of the credit
    goes to Adam Gilbert, and all of the flaws can be attributed to Sarah Lee.
